					<p>
						The goal of this project is to create an automated transport vehicle (ATV) which can independently carry cargo, thereby reducing bodily strain on the user. A reduction of bodily strain would greatly help people with disabilities, since this system will easily transport their heavy possessions. The ATV will be able to navigate through difficult terrain and follow a user via an onboard camera.

						<strong>Bio:</strong>
						I am a proud Computer Science student focusing on the Cybersecurity track. I am second-year student in the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service program and hope to continue my education at the graduate level here at GWU. I studied abroad at Korea University during my sophmore year, and enjoyed learning a new language and culture whilst between intense coding sessions. This will be my first dip into the field of computer vision and robotics, and while I am sure it will be difficult, it is a challenge I have always wanted to pursue.
