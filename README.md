Automated Transport Vehicle

ATV will be able to follow a user through various terrain, over obstacles like curbs and stairs, and keep its cargo area safe and flat. An onboard computer system will be able to identify and follow a designated target within the field of view of the attached Intel Realsense R200 camera.

#Current Progress

Most current work is in Realsense/Projects/personTrackingTest. In the src folder are the files I have been working on. I am currently using the RealSense SDK to track and late a single user using various physical body and color properties.
